# Question:
# Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.
# The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
# 8
# Then, the output should be:
# 40320

# Hints:
# In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

# Factorial of a number

    if(x<=1):
        return 1
    else:
        return x*fact(x-1)
        
print(fact(5))
